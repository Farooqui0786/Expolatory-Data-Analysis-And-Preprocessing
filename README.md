# Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing Project

This repository contains a structured and comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing pipeline for a tabular dataset. It is designed to help understand data distributions, relationships between features, and prepare the dataset for machine learning models using techniques like standardization and normalization.

## üìÅ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Understanding the data.ipynb` | Initial exploration of the dataset, including shape, types, missing values, and basic statistics. |
| `Univariate Analysis (EDA).ipynb` | Analyzes individual features using distributions, histograms, boxplots, etc. |
| `Bivariate_Multivariate Analysis (EDA).ipynb` | Examines relationships between two or more variables using scatter plots, heatmaps, pairplots, etc. |
| `Pandas profiling.ipynb` | Auto-generates a data profiling report using the `pandas-profiling` library. |
| `Standardization.ipynb` | Applies Z-score standardization (mean = 0, std = 1) to scale the numerical data. |
| `Normalization.ipynb` | Applies Min-Max normalization (scales features between 0 and 1). |
